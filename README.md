# SphereHarmonic

This repository contains the Wolfram Mathematica code for the SphereHarmonic,
a project for a new musical instrument based on Japanese Temari balls.

Concept: Maria Mannone and Takashi Yoshino. Coding: Takashi Yoshino.

The idea is described in the article "Temari Balls, Spheres, SphereHarmonic: from Japanese Folkcraft to Music,"
accepted for publication by Algorithms on August 2022.

Abstract: Temari balls are traditional Japanese toys and artworks. The variety of their geometries and tessellations can be investigated
formally and computationally with the means of combinatorics. As a further step, we also propose a musical application of the core idea
of Temari balls. In fact, inspired by the classical idea of music of spheres and by the CubeHarmonic, a musical application
of the Rubik's cube, we present the concept of a new musical instrument, the SphereHarmonic. The mathematical (and musical) description
of Temari balls lies in the wide background of interactions between art and combinatorics. Concerning the methods, we present the tools
of permutations and tessellations we adopted here, and the core idea for the SphereHarmonic. As the results, we first describe a classification
of structures according to the theory of groups. Then, we summarize the main passages implemented in our code, to make the SphereHarmonic
play on a laptop. Our study explores an aspect of the deep connections between the mutually inspiring scientific and artistic thinking.
